            <h2>Principal's Message</h2>
            <p>It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you to Hanna College. This college has completed sixteen years of its fruitful existence and is growing qualitatively. The prospective teachers who have passed out of the college are rendering admirable services not only in the educational sector of the state but also at the national level. I am fully optimistic that the present and future teacher trainees will keep this torch of excellence burning bright till time immemorial in the spheres of life wherever they serve.
                Our academic record has been outstanding since the inception of the institution. Moreover, the college has a commendable record of very high pass percentage every year, with a maximum number of first-class and distinctions in both theory and practice of teaching in the annual university examination results.
                I hope that the students of the present batch would also draw inspiration and benefit from the rich educational environment and attain excellence in the area of teacher education, thus contributing to national development.
